        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          A results-driven and innovative full-stack developer with a strong foundation in building dynamic, user-focused web applications. I am passionate about solving real-world problems with clean, efficient code and continuously improving my craft.
          <br /><br />
          As a young woman in tech, my journey has been shaped by resilience and determination. Coming from a background where further studies were not financially possible, I refused to let that limit my future. Instead, I took ownership of my growth and taught myself how to code — learning through online resources, building projects from scratch, and constantly challenging myself to improve.
          <br /><br />
          This self-taught path has made me adaptable, resourceful, and deeply committed to lifelong learning. Every project I build reflects my dedication to mastering modern technologies and contributing meaningfully to the tech community. I am now seeking an opportunity to join a forward-thinking team where I can leverage my skills, continue growing professionally, and inspire others who come from similar backgrounds.
